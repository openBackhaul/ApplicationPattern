## Basic Services

The basic services are generic across all the Microservices in the application layer. This consists of APIs using which a Microservice can be integrated into the application layer environment.

Totally we have 15 basic services. Please look into the below brief information . (The first 4 services can be accessed without an authorization code)

12.	**/v1/end-subscription** – provides functionality to stop a notification subscription

13.	**/v1/update-client** – Allows updating connection data of a serving application. This service will be called by the registry office to broadcast a server replacement from one version to another
