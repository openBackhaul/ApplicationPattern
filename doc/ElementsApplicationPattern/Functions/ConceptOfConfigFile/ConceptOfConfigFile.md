# Concept of the CONFIGfile

### Background and main purpose of the CONFIGfile
There are numerous communication relationships between applications, due to
-	functions being distributed across many individual applications in a modular application layer
-	and applications consuming functions provided by other applications.  

These communication relationships are directed, meaning that a client is sending requests to a server. For actually reaching the server, the client must correctly addess these requests.

However, the server's address may change.  
For example, a non-backward compatible modification to a function (e.g. a bug fix) would require changing the version number in the URI for calling this function. If address information were hardcoded into the client, the client's program code would require an update in such cases.  
Consequently, a change to an application would require changes to other applications.  
Such propagating need for adaptation would make simple adjustments very cumbersome; and the architecture would be rigid against further development.  
Therefore, address information needs to be configurable in some way and it needs to be saved independently from the program code.  
This is the main purpose of the CONFIGfile.  

**Content: address information and parameter values**  
The CONFIGfile does not just store address information, but also all kinds of parameter values.  
Parameters might be required for e.g., formulas, algorithms, or processes that are executed inside the application.  
Such parameters are usually of primitive data types like Integer or String.  

**Not part of the content: Application Data**
- Some applications build their own data during runtime. Such data would be called ApplicationData.
- Example: the ExecutionAndTraceLog is creating a record for every request executed in the application layer..
- The CONFIGfile shall not contain ApplicationData, but it might contain information that is required for connecting a separate file or database that is holding the ApplicationData.  

### CONFIGfile
Immediately after launching, the application is reading the CONFIGfile.
Consequently, the values that are defined in the CONFIGfile represent the initial state of the application.  

_ConfigFile changes_  
The CONFIGfile is written in JSON format to support being read by JavaScript based applications (note that it could also be handled by any other programming language like e.g. Java, Python or PHP).
It could be manually altered if required but operating the updated configuration would require restarting the application.
The applications, which are based on the MW SDN ApplicationPattern, are supporting changing their configuration via the REST API during runtime.
These changes are then automatically written into the CONFIGfile.  

_Storage_  
The CONFIGfile is stored separately from the code of the application.
So, in case of failure, a new instance of an application could be started with the exact latest configuration of a broken instance.
For completeness, it should be noted that all applications of the MW SDN application layer are stateful due to their configurability.
That state might change over the course of their operation, and it must be kept consistent.
This characteristic makes integration with Kubernetes a bit more complex.
