# Concept of the DATAfile

Applications need an initial state during testing, too.  
Loading this initial state of an application under test into the request collection that is implementing the test cases supports assessing the answers provided by the REST API.  

For the sake of simplicity, the DATAfile includes the configuration of the application under test in the exact same format as the CONFIGfile.  
However, the DATAfile includes some additional information that the request collection requires to address the application under test.
