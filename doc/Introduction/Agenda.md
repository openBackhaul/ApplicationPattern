# Agenda of an Introduction Session  

Action items of the training for ApplicationOwners have changed.  
Please, don't create an _Issue_ for contributing to the agenda of an introduction session, but for improving the documentation.  

Is there a mistake in the training material?  
It there still something unclear or missing?  

Please, create an _Issue_ in the ApplicationPattern repository that documents a need for improving the documentation.  
Assign it to yourself.  
Label should be _documentation_.  
Milestone should be the next release of the specification according to semantic versioning (2.x.y_spec).  

Execute the _Issue_ and address a _Pull-Request_ for consolidating your contribution into the official documentation.
