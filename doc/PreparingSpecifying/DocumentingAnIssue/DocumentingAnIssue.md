# Documenting an Issue

Using the GitHub webGUI is recommended for documenting _Issues_.  
Formulate title and body according to the guidelines for [Formulating Issues](../FormulatingIssues/FormulatingIssues.md).  
Put _Assignee_, _Label_ and _Milestone_.

Alternatively, you can create _Issues_ in VSCode.

Click on the GitHub symbol to the left of the VSCode window.  

![createIssuePicture1](./pictures/createIssue_01.png)  

Expand the list of _Issues_ by clicking the arrow besides "ISSUES".  

![createIssuePicture2](./pictures/createIssue_02.png)  

Click on the "+" symbol besides "ISSUES" for creating a new _Issue_.  

![createIssuePicture3](./pictures/createIssue_03.png)  

Choose the repository, which shall be addressed by the new _Issue_, from the pull-down-menu.  

![createIssuePicture4](./pictures/createIssue_04.png)  

Formulate title and body according to the guidelines for [Formulating Issues](../FormulatingIssues/FormulatingIssues.md).  
Put an assignee and a label.  

![createIssuePicture5](./pictures/createIssue_05.png)  

Complete creating the _Issue_ by clicking the tick in the upper right corner and check for the confirmation at the lower right corner.  

![createIssuePicture6](./pictures/createIssue_06.png)  

If the creation of the _Issue_ has been confirmed, it has also been automatically published on the original repository on GitHub.
