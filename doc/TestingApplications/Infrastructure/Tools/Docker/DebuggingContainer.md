### How to debug/check logs for docker container issues

Most of the previous mentioned commands are used for creation, running and deploy the containers.

For example, when the docker containers are exited due to some issue, to find out the root cause, we have to check information about container and related logs.

* As a first step, all running and exited containers can be listed from below command

        docker ps -a

* Select the container id and inspect the container using below command. With this command output gives the overall status of container includes state, path, image and logpath etc.

        docker inspect < containerId/containerName>

Below is an example for one of the application:

         WebApp@WebApp:/var/lib/docker$ docker inspect registry-office-v1
        [
        {
        "Id":"3e232",
        "Created": "2022-09-04T14:55:43.652797544Z",
        "Path": "docker-entrypoint.sh",
        "Args": [
            "node",
            "index.js"
        ],
        "State": {
            "Status": "EXITED",
            "Running": true,
            "Paused": false,
            "Restarting": false,
            "OOMKilled": false,
            "Dead": false,
            "Pid": 2498488,
            "ExitCode": 137,
            "Error": "",
            "StartedAt": "2022-09-05T11:31:42.352471453Z",
            "FinishedAt": "2022-09-05T11:31:40.959561887Z"
        },
        "Image": 
        "ResolvConfPath": ,
        "HostnamePath": ",
        "HostsPath":,
        "LogPath": "/var/lib/docker/containers/207f3f43e0e2585bee11193f163772641cf1be48f04f734da898a5df0d43e232/207f3f43e0e2585bee11193f163772641cf1be48f04f734da898a5df0d43e232-json.log".

Based on this information, able to get the data related to images, logs path, state of container etc.

* Fetch the container logs using below command 

         docker logs -f <containerId/containerName>
Example logs: 

        WebApp@WebApp:/var/lib/docker$ docker logs -f registry-office-v1

* Stats the container information using below command and it will give live stream of resource usage with consumed memory details.

        docker stats <container_id>
