## Application Deployment in Testbed
This section explains how to deploy application through jenkins automation job using docker framework in testbed.

## Automated pipeline steps
- Pipeline job creation
- Build the declarative pipeline script
- Verification of application status
- Run the Automation testsuites
 
### Create pipeline jobs with all necessary configurations

Please refer the previous section for [creating the jenkins job](../Tools/Jenkins/JenkinsJobsAndSDNDeployment.md#list-of-jenkins-jobs)

### Declarative pipeline script
For automating the procedure, groovy scripting, docker commands and few shell commands are used.
Below are the stages executed as part of script

- Source stage where takes the clone of source code from github as local repository
- Docker build stage which cleans the old image data and build the new image
- Deploy application image as a container
- Save docker image as tar file in local server.
- Execute automated acceptance testsuites and collects html test reports by test server.
- Approve build for production if everything ok in testing

#### Example groovy pipeline script
 
        
    pipeline {
      agent {
        label 'WebApp'
      }
      stages {
        stage ('source stage') {
           git branch: 'develop', url: 'https://github.com/openBackhaul/RegistryOffice.git'
       }
      stage ('setup and image build') {
        steps {
          <execute the FakeToOriginalIPConverter script for changing the application default ip address to actual ip address >
          sh 'docker build -t <imagename> .'
          sh 'docker volume create <volumename>'
          .....
        }
      }
      stage('Run Docker container') {
        steps {
        sh 'docker run -d -p XXXX:XXXX --name <containername> -v <volumename>:<path of the volumetobecreated> <imagename>'
        sh 'docker ps -a'
      }
       }
      stage('save Docker image') {
        steps{
                sh 'docker save -o /home/WebApp/gitlab_stage/docker-images-list/RO/cicd_user-registry-office-v2-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S).tar cicd_user/registry-office-v2'
                }
            }
        }
    }
  
**Note** : above provided sample script code is just an example, based on the requirement user can develop his own groovy script/shell script.
    
### Verification of application status
Once Applications (ex: RO,TAR,EATL etc) deployed as containers, go to the browser and check the Ip address with port XXXX (exposed in docker file) is accessible or not. if it accessible then application swagger started up and running.

Below is the URL format of the swagger created for application pattern applications.

    http://<serverIp>:<port>/docs/
Below is the example of RegistryOffice application which deployed on testbed already and attached the picture.

### Run Automation Testsuites 
Once application deployment is done, automatically the testing job started to test the testcases. The testing will be performed on testserver as mentioned earlier.
