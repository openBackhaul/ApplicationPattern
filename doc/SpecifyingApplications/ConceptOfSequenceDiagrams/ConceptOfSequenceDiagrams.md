# Concept of the Sequence Diagrams

The sequence diagrams are a visualization of the individual forwardings and define the interactions between operation servers and operation clients (which can be from both the application to specify or 3rd applications).  

Creating the sequence diagrams goes hand in hand with creating the ServiceList, which contains the building blocks for the diagrams - i.e. the operation servers and operation clients. By bringing those building blocks together, still missing entries in the ServiceList can be identified.  
The diagrams also show the relevant input and output between the different building blocks.

As the diagrams are specified in PlantUML, they can be easily modified anytime. See [SketchingIdeas](../TestCaseCollection/SketchingIdeas/SketchingIdeas.md) for more information about PlantUML.
